### About me

Hi, I should really start doing stuff outside of my assignments so this is where I'll hopefully be able to add some side projects
- 💻 I'm a second year uni student studying Cybersecurity Engineering.
- 👩‍🎓 Currently learning C, C++, and Java in my uni courses.
- ✏️ Looking to start a side project after I finish exams :)
